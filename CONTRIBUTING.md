## How to contribute

Whether you want to contribute to your new repository or you want to update ERNI awesome resource list the process is the same:

1. [**Fork the repository**][fork] to your personal Github. Forking is basically an easy way to make a duplicate of the repository to your own account.
2. [**Clone**][clone] the project to your own machine.

    ```sh
    # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
    # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
    cd <repo-name>
    # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upsteam-owner>/<repo-name>
    ```

3. If you cloned a while ago, get the **latest changes** from upstream.

    ```sh
    git checkout <dev-branch>
    git pull upstream <dev-branch>
    ```

4. Create a new **topic branch** (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix.

    ```sh
    git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
    ```

5. **Commit** changes to your own branch.

    ```sh
    git commit -m 'Add some feature'
    ```

6. **Locally merge** (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch.

    ```sh
    git pull [--rebase] upstream <dev-branch>
    ```

7. [**Push**][push] your topic branch up to your fork.

    ```sh
    git push origin <topic-branch-name>
    ```

8. Open a [**Pull Request**][pull] with a clear title and description so that we can review your changes.

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this repository.
