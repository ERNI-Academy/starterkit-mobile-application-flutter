Entities are objects that represent the fundamental concepts of the problem domain and encapsulate business logic.

Below is an example of an entity class:

```dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';

class PostEntity with EquatableMixin {
  static const PostEntity empty = PostEntity(userId: 0, id: 0, title: '', body: '');

  const PostEntity({required this.userId, required this.id, required this.title, required this.body});

  final int userId;

  final int id;

  final String title;

  final String body;

  @override
  List<Object> get props => <Object>[userId, id, title, body];
}
```

- We use `EquatableMixin` to make the entity comparable. When using this, we should make the class immutable by using `final` and `const` constructor.
- We also define a static empty instance of the entity. This is useful when we want to initialize the entity with empty values. As opposed to checking an instance of `PostEntity` for null, we can check if it is equal to `PostEntity.empty. This eliminates the need for null checks.
